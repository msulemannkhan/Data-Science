### Solutions
* Regularization  (adding a penalty for complexity)
* Stratified k-fold Cross-Validation
* Early Stopping - Stopping point should be where Loss on Training set decreases but Validation set increases
* Increase amount of data
* Ensemble algorithms like Bagging
* Drop out in case of Neural Nets
* Thresholdout
  * Differential Privacy - On an intuitive level, differential privacy hides the data of any single individual. We are thus interested in pairs of datasets S, S0 that differ in a single element, in which case we say S and S0 are adjacent.
  * Adaptive data analysis: Though we use a holdout set to verify our model built on training set, we use holdout set to revise parameters or algorithm, this frequantly leads to over-fitting on holdout set. Adaptive data analysis is to use a seperate holdout dataset to validate any finding obtained via adaptive analysis.

### Regularization
Complex models are bad. It is the process of adding a tuning parameter to a model to induce smoothness in order to prevent overfitting. One of the ways to keep our model simple is by applying regularization and adjust the rate until we achieve an acceptable performance. 
* It discourages learning a more complex model
* A new term is added to the loss function(SSE in Regression) 
* Ridge = SSE + α(Sum of square of coefficients) - Square of coeffs implies power=2 hence L2
* Lasso = SSE + α(Absolute value of coefficients) - Absolute value implies power=1 hence L1
* Elastic Net = SSE + α2(Sum of square of coefficients) + α1(Absolute value of coefficients)
  * α = 0: Same as Simple linear regression
  * α = ∞: Coeffs will be 0
  * 0 < α < ∞: how much we want to penalize the flexibility of our model.

### Stratified k-fold Cross-validation
In cross-validation, the confusion matrix is from 10 diff models applied on 10 non-overlapping TEST data. It is used to evaluate model but the model that we get from cross-validation is the model built on entire training data </br>


Cross-validation, it’s a model validation techniques for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis (model) will generalize to an independent data set. It is mainly used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform in practice.
* Validation help us evaluate the quality of the model
* Validation help us select the model which will perform best on unseen data
* Validation help us to avoid overfitting and underfitting.

* By reducing the training data, we risk losing important patterns/ trends in data set, which in turn increases error induced by bias. So, what we require is a method that provides ample data for training the model and also leaves ample data for validation. K Fold cross validation does exactly that.
* Every data point gets to be in a validation set exactly once, and gets to be in a training set k-1times. This significantly reduces underfitting as we are using most of the data for fitting, and also significantly reduces overfitting as most of the data is also being used in validation set.
* Leave 1 out is used when there is too little data and fast enough model to retrain.  
* As the number of folds increasing the error due the bias decreasing (i.e model predictions are close to correctness) but increasing the error due to variance (Model predcitions are more spread out)

### Thresholdout
##### How Thresholdout works?
Implementation in Python https://github.com/bmcmenamin/thresholdOut-explorations/blob/master/Threshold%20out%20demos%20--%20tuning%20parameters%20for%20linear%20regression.ipynb <br/>
https://andyljones.tumblr.com/post/127547085623/holdout-reuse <br/>
Based on 2 key Ideas:
* First, the validation should not reveal any information about the holdout dataset if the analyst does not overfit to the training set.
* Second, an addition of a small amount of noise to any validation result can prevent the analyst from overfitting to the holdout set. <br/>
In a nutshell, the reusable holdout mechanism is simply this: access the holdout set only through a suitable differentially private algorithm. It is important to note, however, that the user does not need to understand differential privacy to use our method. The user interface of the reusable holdout is the same as that of the widely used classical method.

##### Thresholdout - Reusable holdout sets
* The limit of the method is determined by the size of the holdout set - the number of times that the holdout set may be used grows roughly as the square of the number of collected data points in the holdout, as our theory shows.
* Based on Differential privacy - It is a notion of stability requiring that any single sample should not influence the outcome of the analysis significantly.

##### Advantages of Thresholdout
* Stability - Modifying a single data point doesn't chnage outcome too much
* Differential privacy - Notion of privacy-preserving data analysis. Differential privacy is a strong form of stability that allows
adaptive/sequential composition of different analyses
What sets differential privacy apart from other stability notions is that it is preserved by adaptive composition. Combining multiple algorithms that each preserve differential privacy yields a new algorithm that also satisfies differential privacy albeit at some quantitative loss in the stability guarantee. This is true even if the output of one algorithm influences the choice of the next. This strong adaptive composition property is what makes differential privacy an excellent stability notion for adaptive data analysis.
