### Model Interpretation
When comparing models, besides model performance, a model is said to have a better interpretability than another model if its decisions are easier to understand by a human than the decisions from the other model.  <br/>
* Model performance is not the run-time or execution performance, but how accurate the model can be in making decisions.
* What drives model predictions? Which features are imp in decision-making policies of the model - ensures FAIRNESS of the model.
* Why did the model take a certain decision? Validate and justify why certain key features were responsible in driving certain decisions taken by a model during predictions - ensures ACCOUNTABILITY and RELIABILITY of the model.
* How can we trust model predictions? We should be able to evaluate and validate any data point and how a model takes decisions on it - ensures TRANSPARENCY of the model.
  <br/>
  <br/>
* Global Interpretation - Being able to explain the conditional interaction between dependent and independent variables based on the complete dataset
* Local Interpretation - Being able to explain the conditional interaction between dependent and independent variables wrt to a single prediction

Traditional techniques for Model interpretation are 
* Exploratory analysis and visualization techniques like clustering and dimensionality reduction.
* Model performance evaluation metrics like precision, recall, accuracy, ROC curve and the AUC (for classification models) and the coefficient of determination (R-square), root mean-square error, mean absolute error (for regression models)


### Techniques
* Using Interpretable Models - DT, Linear Reg, Logistic reg, Naive Bayes, KNN
* Feature Importance using SHAP, Skater
* Partial Dependence Plots using SHAP, Skater
* Global Surrogate Models
* LIME - Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations
* SHAP - Shapley Values and SHapley Additive exPlanations

Concept behind global interpretations of model-agnostic feature importance
* We measure a feature’s importance by calculating the increase of the model’s prediction error after perturbing the feature.
* A feature is “important” if perturbing its values increases the model error, because the model relied on the feature for the prediction.
* A feature is “unimportant” if perturbing its values keeps the model error unchanged, because the model basically ignored the feature for the prediction.

### Frameworks
* ELI5
* Skater
* SHAP

### ELI5
https://github.com/TeamHG-Memex/eli5
ELI5 is a Python package which helps to debug machine learning classifiers and explain their predictions in an easy to understand an intuitive way. It is perhaps the easiest of the three machine learning frameworks to get started with since it involves minimal reading of documentation! However it doesn’t support true model-agnostic interpretations and support for models are mostly limited to tree-based and other parametric\linear models.


### Skater
Frameworks like Skater compute Feature importance based on an information theoretic criteria, measuring the entropy in the change of predictions, given a perturbation of a given feature. The intuition is that the more a model’s decision criteria depend on a feature, the more we’ll see predictions change as a function of perturbing a feature.

SHAP values are used for both local & global interpretability

SHAP value explanation of a single prediction:
![](https://i.imgur.com/JVD2U7k.png)
We predicted 0.7, whereas the base_value is 0.4979. Feature values causing increased predictions are in pink, and their visual size shows the magnitude of the feature's effect. Feature values decreasing the prediction are in blue. The biggest impact comes from Goal Scored being 2. Though the ball possession value has a meaningful effect decreasing the prediction.

The Shapley value is the average marginal contribution of a feature value over all possible coalitions. Coalitions are basically combinations of features which are used to estimate the shapley value of a specific feature. 

Frameworks like SHAP, use a combination of feature contributions and game theory to come up with SHAP values. Then, it computes the global feature importance by taking the average of the SHAP value magnitudes across the dataset.  <br/>
Assuming that each feature is a ‘player’ in a game where the prediction is the payout. The Shapley value — a method from coalitional game theory — tells us how to fairly distribute the ‘payout’ among the features. The Shapley value, coined by Shapley, is a method for assigning payouts to players depending on their contribution towards the total payout. Players cooperate in a coalition and obtain a certain gain from that cooperation.
* The ‘game’ is the prediction task for a single instance of the dataset.
* The ‘gain’ is the actual prediction for this instance minus the average prediction of all instances.
* The ‘players’ are the feature values of the instance, which collaborate to receive the gain (= predict a certain value).
The Shapley value is the average marginal contribution of a feature value over all possible coalitions. Coalitions are basically combinations of features which are used to estimate the shapley value of a specific feature. Typically more the features, it starts increasing exponentially hence it may take a lot of time to compute these values for big or wide datasets. 


### Global Surrogate Models
It is a way of building intepretable approximations of really complex models, global surrogate models.  <br/>
A global surrogate model is an interpretable model that is trained to approximate the predictions of a black box model which can essentially be any model regardless of its complexity or training algorithm.  <br/>
* Steps involved in building surrogate models:  <br/>
  * Choose a dataset This could be the same dataset that was used for training the black box model or a new dataset from the same distribution. You could even choose a subset of the data or a grid of points, depending on your application.
  * For the chosen dataset, get the predictions of your base black box model.
  * Choose an interpretable surrogate model (linear model, decision tree, …).
  * Train the interpretable model on the dataset and its predictions (Predictions from Black box are used as Targets).
  * Congratulations! You now have a surrogate model.
  * Measure how well the surrogate model replicates the prediction of the black box model.
  * Interpret / visualize the surrogate model.
* Models that can be used
  * Classification: Logistic Reg, Decision Trees, RuleFit, Naive Bayes
  * Regression: Linear Reg, Decision Trees, RuleFit
* Surrogate model approximates the underlying black box behavior quite well, but not perfectly. If the fit were perfect, we could throw away blackbox model and use the Surrogate model instead.
* Disadvantage
  * Conclusions are drawn about the model and not the data, since the model never sees true outcomes
  * Desired accuracy of a surrogate requires more simulations than we can afford
* Techniques:
  * Screening & variable reduction - Use all the variables of the data and not the ones used by only Blackbox model 
    * OAT (One-at-a-time) - Does not estimate interaction effects between variables
    * ANOVA
    * IFFD (Iterated Fractional factorial design - Economical for large number of variables. Uses clustered sampling techniques
    * Bettonvil’s sequential bifurcation method
    * Sobol’s global sensitivity analysis (GSA)
    * VaschyBuckingham theorem
    * Nondimensional variables
  * Simulataneous use of multiple surrogates
  * Sequential sampling & Optimization
  * Conservative estimators
 

### LIME
https://medium.com/@ageitgey/natural-language-processing-is-fun-part-3-explaining-model-predictions-486d8616813c </br>
* LIME creates explanations for blackbox predictions by training an interpretable model locally around a prediction you want to explain.
* It focuses to explain why single predictions were made instead of trying to fit a global surrogate model. 
* LimeTabularExplainer: explains predictions on tabular, or matrix, data
* LimeImageExplainer: explains predictions on image data
* LimeTextExplainer: explains text classifiers

* Steps: In order learn behavior of the model
  * Make initial predictions of the instance of interest with the blackbox model
  * LIME perturbs the instance it will explain to create sample variations around it and weighs them by the proximity to the instance being explained
  * Get the predictions for these perturbed instances using the blackbox model
  * The perturbed instances (samples close to the instance are given more weightage) becomes the new training set and a linear classifier is trained on them to understand the predictions
  * LIME uses Ridge regression by default but can be changed

* Output
  * For text : It represents presence/absence of words.
  * For image : It represents presence/absence of super pixels ( contiguous patch of similar pixels ). 
  * For tabular data : It is a weighted combination of columns.

* Support & Contradict Predictions
  * If a prediction is 1 or 0, Support predictions gives the list of variables that favour either 1 or 0. Favors predicted outcome
  * Contradict predictions are the ones that support opposite of the prediction. Don't favor the predicted outcome
