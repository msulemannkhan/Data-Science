### Advances in NLP - https://ruder.io/a-review-of-the-recent-history-of-nlp/
* Neural Language Models - Language modelling is the task of predicting the next word in a text given the previous words. Egs - Intelligent keyboards, email response suggestion, spelling autocorrection, etc. Approaches are n-grams. Started with feed forward NN and currently uses RNNs, LSTM. 
* Multi-task Learning - Method for sharing parameters between models that are trained on multiple tasks. In neural networks, this can be done easily by tying the weights of different layers.
* Word embeddings - word2vec. Training on a very large corpus enables them to approximate certain relations between words such as gender, verb tense, and country-capital relations. </br>
  * Later Studies showed that there is nothing inherently special about word2vec: Word embeddings can also be learned via matrix factorization and with proper tuning, classic matrix factorization approaches like SVD and LSA achieve similar results.
* Neural Networks for NLP - 
  * Most of the tasks in NLP such as text classification, language modeling, machine translation, etc. are sequence modeling tasks. The traditional machine learning models and neural networks cannot capture the sequential information present in the text. Therefore, people started using recurrent neural networks (RNN and LSTM) because these architectures can model sequential information present in the text. However, these recurrent neural networks have their own set of problems. One major issue is that RNNs can not be parallelized because they take one input at a time. In the case of a text sequence, an RNN or LSTM would take one token at a time as input. So, it will pass through the sequence token by token. Hence, training such a model on a big dataset will take a lot of time.
  * Recurrent NN (LSTM are more resilient to the vanishing and exploding gradient problem. A bidirectional LSTM is typically used to deal with both left and right context)
  * CNN (For text it only operates in 2 dimensions, with filters only needing to be moved along the temporal dimension. CNNs are more parallelizable than RNNs, as the state at every timestep only depends on the local context ,via the convolution operation, rather than all past states as in the RNN. CNNs can be extended with wider receptive fields using dilated convolutions to capture a wider context. CNNs and LSTMs can also be combined and stacked and convolutions can be used to speed up an LSTM) 
  * Recursive NN - RNNs and CNNs both treat the language as a sequence. From a linguistic perspective, however, language is inherently hierarchical: Words are composed into higher-order phrases and clauses, which can themselves be recursively combined according to a set of production rules. The linguistically inspired idea of treating sentences as trees rather than as a sequence gives rise to recursive neural networks. Bottom up approach and not left-to-right or right-to-left. Not only RNNs and LSTMs can be extended to work with hierarchical structures. Word embeddings can be learned based not only on local but on grammatical context ; language models can generate words based on a syntactic stack ; and graph-convolutional neural networks can operate over a tree 
* Sequence to sequence models -
  * https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/
  * A sequence-to-sequence model is a model that takes a sequence of items (words, letters, features of an images…etc) and outputs another sequence of items. In neural machine translation, a sequence is a series of words, processed one after another. The output is, likewise, a series of words. 
  * Model is composed of an encoder and decoder. The encoder processes each item in the input sequence, it compiles the information it captures into a vector (called the context i.e an array of numbers). After processing the entire input sequence, the encoder sends the context over to the decoder, which begins producing the output sequence item by item. Size of the context vector is the number of hidden units in the encoder. Encoder takes 2 inputs at each step: one word from the input sentence i.e represented as vector (Word is trandformed into a vector using word embedding algos) and a hidden state. We get an updated hidden state in the output from first step. In the 2nd step of encoding 2nd word and hidden step output from first step are sent as input. And only the last hidden state from Encoding stage is sent to every step of Decoding stage. Every step of decoding stage takes 2 inputs: Last hidden state from encoding stage and hidden state obtained from the previous step of decoding 
  * Applications include Machine Transalation, generating a caption based on an image , text based on a table, text summarization, and a description based on source code changes.   Generate an output sequence by predicting one word at a time. For continuency parsing and Named Entity recognition. Transformer 
* Attention Mechanism - Transformer networks - BERT, GPT-2 </br>
  * https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/
  * Instead of passing the last hidden state of the encoding stage, the encoder passes all the hidden states to the decoder
  * Second, an attention decoder does an extra step before producing its output. In order to focus on the parts of the input that are relevant to this decoding time step, the decoder does the following:
    * Look at the set of encoder hidden states it received – each encoder hidden states is most associated with a certain word in the input sentence
    * Give each hidden states a score (let’s ignore how the scoring is done for now)
    * Multiply each hidden states by its softmaxed score, thus amplifying hidden states with high scores, and drowning out hidden states with low scores
  * The main bottleneck of sequence-to-sequence learning is that it requires to compress the entire content of the source sequence into a fixed-size vector. Attention alleviates this by allowing the decoder to look back at the source sequence hidden states, which are then provided as a weighted average as additional input to the decoder. Attention is widely applicable and potentially useful for any task that requires making decisions based on certain parts of the input. It has been applied to consituency parsing , reading comprehension (Hermann et al., 2015), and one-shot learning, among many others. The input does not even need to be a sequence, but can consist of other representations as in the case of image captioning. A useful side-effect of attention is that it provides a rare---if only superficial---glimpse into the inner workings of the model by inspecting which parts of the input are relevant for a particular output based on the attention weights. Attention is also not restricted to just looking at the input sequence; self-attention can be used to look at the surrounding words in a sentence or document to obtain more contextually sensitive word representations. Multiple layers of self-attention are at the core of the Transformer architecture.
* Self-Attention (Transformer):
  * https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/
  * https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/10/understanding-transformers-data-science-way.html
  * Disadvantages of Attention: Due to the fundamental constraint of sequential computation in Attention mechanism, it is not possible to parallelize the network, which makes it hard to train on long sequences. This, in turn, puts a constraint on the batch size that can be used while training. This has been alleviated by the transformer. Attention based model would inadvertently give a higher weight-age to the elements in the sequence closer to a position. Though this might make sense in the sense of understanding the grammatical formation of various parts of the sentence, it is hard to find relations between words far apart in the sentence.
  * Transformer Architecture - Parallelization technique. It follows the encoder-decoder design, meanwhile replacing the LSTMs with Self Attention layer and the sequential nature being identified using the Positional Encodings.  
    * Contains Encoding component (contains stack of encoders) and Decoding compnent (contains stack of decoders)
    * Number of encoders and decoders within Encoding component and Decoding compnent respectively is usually the length of the longest sentence in our training dataset
    * Each encoder within Encoding component contains a self-attention layer (layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word) and Feed Forward Neural Network. Input to the encoder flows through a self-attention layer and output from self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. Output from feed-forward neural network is sent as input to the next encoder
    * Each decoder within Decoding component contains a self-attention layer; Encoder-Decoder Attention layer (helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence) and Feed Forward Neural Network.
    * Only the first encoder recieves input as list of vectors. (Each word is converted into a vector using an embedding algorithm)
    * Self-Attention layer: The resulting vector from 6th step is one we can send along to the feed-forward neural network. In the actual implementation, however, this calculation is done in matrix form for faster processing.
      * First Step: Each input vector(a word is converted to vector using embedding algos)  is multiplyed with 3 matrices that are trained during the training process to create 3 vectors i.e. Query vector(q1 for first word, q2 for second word etc), a Key vector(k1 for first word, k2 for second word etc), and a Value vector(v1 for first word, v2 for second word etc). Input vectors of dimension 512, when multiplied with matrices of lower dimension results in lower dimensional vector 
      * Second Step: To calculate self-attention for first word - We need to score each word of the input sentence against this word.The score determines how much focus to place on other parts of the input sentence as we encode a word at a certain position. For eg: if we’re processing the self-attention for the word in position #1, the first score would be the dot product of q1 and k1. The second score would be the dot product of q1 and k2.
      * Thirst & Fourth Steps: divide the scores by 8 (the square root of the dimension of the key vectors used in the paper – 64. sq roor of 64=8). This leads to having more stable gradients. There could be other possible values here, but this is the default), then pass the result through a softmax operation. Softmax normalizes the scores so they’re all positive and add up to 1. This softmax score determines how much each word will be expressed at this position. Clearly the word at this position will have the highest softmax score, but sometimes it’s useful to attend to another word that is relevant to the current word.
      * Fifth Step: Multiply each value vector (v1, v2, v3 etc) by the softmax score. The intuition here is to keep intact the values of the word(s) we want to focus on, and drown-out irrelevant words (by multiplying them by tiny numbers like 0.001, for example).
      * Sixth Step: sum up the weighted value vectors.This produces the output of the self-attention layer at this position (for the first word).
    * In case of multi headed attention, we will have mutiple sets of Query,Key,Value weight matrices implies 8 or x sets with each set containing 3 matrices. So each input vector is multiplied with each set of 3 matrices. so after sixth step we get 8 diff weighted value vectors which are concatenated and multiplied with weight matrix W0 to produce a single matrix i.e. output of the layer

![](https://jalammar.github.io/images/t/transformer_resideual_layer_norm_3.png)
    * The output from Encoding component is used by each decoder of the Decoding component. The self-attention layer is only allowed to attend to earlier positions in the output sequence. This is done by masking future positions (setting them to -inf) before the softmax step in the self-attention calculation. The “Encoder-Decoder Attention” layer works just like multiheaded self-attention, except it creates its Queries matrix from the layer below it, and takes the Keys and Values matrix from the output of the encoder stack.
    * The decoder stack outputs a vector of floats. Final Linear layer & Softmax layer turns vector of floats to word. The Linear layer is a simple fully connected neural network that projects the vector produced by the stack of decoders, into a much, much larger vector called a logits vector. The softmax layer then turns those scores into probabilities (all positive, all add up to 1.0). The cell with the highest probability is chosen, and the word associated with it is produced as the output for this time step.
* Memory based networks
* Pretrained language models
* Transfer Learning: The use of models trained on a particular domain of learning tasks and repurposing the learned weights to solve another similar learning task is called transfer learning. Fine-tuning is the process of updating weights of a pre-trained model
  * Train the entire architecture: Error is back-propagated through the entire architecture and the pre-trained weights of the model are updated based on the new dataset.
  * Train some layers while freezing others: we can do keep the weights of initial layers of the model frozen while we retrain only the higher layers.
  * Freeze the entire architecture: Freeze all the layers of the model and attach a few neural network layers of our own and train this new model. Note that the weights of only the attached layers will be updated during model training.
